    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
     For a class assignment in <b>CSCI 1300: User Interfaces / User Experiences</b> at Brown University, I was asked to develop an interactive app that aggregated items that the user selected from a list. The goal of this assignment was to give me the opportunity to practice my React skills.
     <br><br>
     So, bored over Thanksgiving break, I developed <b>Yung Gravy Hits</b>: a React app designed to simulate the interface that Spotify and other music streaming applications provide for adding and removing songs to and from a listening queue.

    <h1>Choosing a theme</h1>
    <div class="image-wrapper sketch">
      <img class="outlined" src="assets/yung-gravy-rapper.gif" />
    </div>
    <p>
      <b>I chose Yung Gravy to be the theme of my app.</b> Why? Why not... you know.... food, or cats, or any one of the other themes that people usually pick for their prototypes?
      If I can be honest with you... I do not really know. All I can tell is that the idea came to me in a moment of inspiration at a coffee shop over Thanksgiving break.
    </p>
    <h2>
      So do you like Yung Gravy?
    </h2>
    <p>Great question. <b>No.</b> I barely tolerate him.</p>
    <h2>
      I don't understand.
    </h2>
    <p>Neither do I. Great talk.</p>
    <h1>Usability Principles</h1>
    <div class="image-wrapper sketch">
      <img class="outlined" src="assets/screenshot.png" />
    </div>
    <p>These are the usability principles I considered while developing the app.</p>
    <div class="carousel">
      <div class="principle item first" id="principle-1">
        <span class="number">1</span>
        <div>
          <h3>Hierarchy</h3>
          <p>The page is broken up into two vertical sections: the header, and the page content. The page content is then broken up into two horizontal sections: the queue on the left, and the songs on the right. Within the songs section, the filters are nested together up top, and the actual list of songs is positioned below. Each item in the list is a vertically stacked row, with the primary properties of the song -- its album, name, and rating -- on the left -- while the secondary properties -- listens, duration, and release year -- are located to the right if the user wants more information.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="principle item" id="principle-2">
        <span class="number">2</span>
        <div>
          <h3>Efficiency</h3>
          <p>The list of songs is filtered and sorted accordingly within moments of the user changing the filters and sorting algorithm via the controls at the top of the songs section. Likewise, queue entries are added and removed within moments of a user clicking on a song or a queue entry, respectively. In short, the reactivity of the page makes it more efficient than the alternative of having to refresh every time a state change occurs.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="principle item" id="principle-3">
        <span class="number">3</span>
        <div>
          <h3>Memorizability</h3>
          <p>The song and queue entry components share a visual and interactive correspondence. In other words, not only do they look the same, but they both have a hover state that adds or removes an entry from the queue. This correspondence makes the application more memorizable because the user can know what to expect from a queue entry component by interacting with a song component, and vice versa.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="buttons">
      <button class="button" onclick="selectPrinciple(1)">1</button>
      <button class="button" onclick="selectPrinciple(2)">2</button>
      <button class="button" onclick="selectPrinciple(3)">3</button>
    </div>
    <h1>My state management</h1>
    <h2>Components</h2>
    <p>My React app has <strong>seven</strong> components arranged in the following hierarchy:</p>
    <div class="image-wrapper sketch">
      <img src="assets/components.png" />
    </div>
    <h2>
      State
    </h2>
    <p>In general, all state is stored by components on a need-to-know basis.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <strong>App</strong> component stores the list of entries for the queue so that it can pass down functions to add and remove from the queue to the <strong>Queue</strong> and <strong>Songs</strong> components.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>Queue</strong> component stores none of its own state because all of it is stored with the <strong>App</strong> component as described above. It passes down each entry included in the entries passed down to it by the <strong>App</strong> component to each <strong>Entry</strong> component.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>Songs</strong> component stores the state for the two filters and one sorting dropdown so that it can apply them to the arrangement of the list of <strong>Song</strong> components.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <strong>Songs</strong>, <strong>Song</strong>, <strong>Entry</strong>, and <strong>Album</strong> components all draw directly on static data defined in the <code>data.json</code> file. This data is never represented as state because it never needs to be mutated.
      </li>
    </ul>
