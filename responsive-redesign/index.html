      <p>
        Not too long ago, visiting <b>triolosbakery.com</b> in your web browser would have taken you to the website for Triolos Bakery, a small bakery in the town of Bedford NH. But there was just one problem: the website was built by a former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX</a> developer who put it together using the rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS that he picked up in the nineties. And it looked the part.
        For a class assignment in CSCI 1300: User Interfaces / User Experiences at Brown University, I designed a responsive replacement for the website based on my evaluation of its usability.

      <h1>Out with the old...</h1>
      <h2>triolosbakery.com (circa 2019)</h2>
      <div class="image-wrapper sketch">

      </div>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>I identified <b>five</b> problems with the old website.</p>
      <div class="carousel">
        <div class="problem" id="problem-1">
          <span class="number">1</span>
          <div>
            <p>The old website was <b>not responsive</b>. In particular, the navigation menu and center image did not adapt to a tablet or mobile screen.</p>
            <p><b>Key concepts</b></p>
            <p>Responsive, Hierarchy</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="problem" id="problem-2" style="display: none">
          <span class="number">2</span>
          <div>
            <p>The old website drew the attention of a new visitor to the centered image of the bakery <b>without doing anything</b> with that attention.</p>
            <p><b>Key concepts</b></p>
            <p>Learnability</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="problem" id="problem-3" style="display: none">
          <span class="number">3</span>
          <div>
            <p>The navigation menu offered <b>too many options</b> to choose from, including the secondary items that appeared upon hover.</p>
            <p><b>Key concepts</b></p>
            <p>Memorability, Learnability</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="problem" id="problem-4" style="display: none">
          <span class="number">4</span>
          <div>
            <p>The old website had <b>a lot of empty space</b> without a purpose, especially the space around the centered image of the bakery</p>
            <p><b>Key concepts</b></p>
            <p>Efficiency, Layout</p>
          </div>

        <div class="problem" id="problem-5" style="display: none">
          <span class="number">5</span>
          <div>
            <p>The old website <b>effectively hid</b> the contact information from new visitors by including it at the bottom and using a tiny font size.</p>
            <p><b>Key concepts</b></p>
            <p>Learnability, Efficiency</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="buttons">
        <button class="button" onclick="selectProblem(1)">1</button>
        <button class="button" onclick="selectProblem(2)">2</button>
        <button class="button" onclick="selectProblem(3)">3</button>
        <button class="button" onclick="selectProblem(4)">4</button>
        <button class="button" onclick="selectProblem(5)">5</button>
      </div>
      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p>I also entered the old website into the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a> tool to evaluate it in terms of its accessibility. On the one hand, the website had a few problems: it did not specify that it used the English language; it had an empty link that went nowhere; a few links were duplicates; and the copyright at the text was too small for users to see. On the other hand, many of its images had alternative text available, and it made use of a structured navigation menu with several tiers.</p>
      <h1>In with the new!</h1>
      <h2>Low-fidelity prototypes</h2>
      <p>With the usability problems of the old website written out, I tried to solve those problems through the set of low-fidelity prototypes below. <b>Zoom in</b> to each of the three wireframes in the embedded Figma file below to see my annotations on how I solved each problem.</p>

      <h2>Style guide</h2>
      <p>Before I made high-fidelity prototypes from my low-fi's, I made this style guide so that my high-fidelity prototypes would share a consistent style.</p>
