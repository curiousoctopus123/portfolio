      <p>
        The RIPTA (<b>R</b>hode <b>I</b>sland <b>P</b>ublic <b>T</b>ransit <b>A</b>uthority) bus system is the premiere public transit system of Providence, Rhode Island. To fund it, the city collects a small fee from each rider as soon as they step onto a bus. For a class assignment in <b>CSCI 1300: User Interfaces / User Experiences</b> at Brown University, I developed a storyboard and two personas based on my observations and interviews of riders interacting with the payment system to understand it better while practicing some of the basic methods of user interface design.

      <p>
        The RIPTA payment system affords riders <b>seven</b> distinct methods of instant payment when they step onto the bus. A rider can either scan their RIPTA-issued "WAVE" card in one of <b>two</b> ways via the card scanner, pictured right, or employ one of <b>five</b> alternative methods of payment using the rectangular metal device, pictured center.

      <h1 id="observations">Observations & Interviews</h1>
      Over nearly an hour of riding the RIPTA bus, I observed just over a dozen riders interact with the payment system, and interviewed three.
      <h2>Key Observations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No matter how they paid, stepped onto the bus with their card or cash in hand.</li>
        <li>The typical rider spent no more than 2-3 seconds paying.</li>
        <li>Of the seven methods of payment available to riders, cash took the longest.</li>
        <li>Most riders paid for the bus using a WAVE or Brown University ID card.</li>
        <li>Riders knew their payment went through once the payment system beeped.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>My Interviews</h2>
      I asked the following set of six questions to three riders:
      <ol>
        <li>Why are you taking the RIPTA today?</li>
        <li>When you saw the RIPTA approaching, did you do or think anything to prepare to pay?</li>
        <li>How did you expect the interaction to go when you saw the RIPTA approach?</li>
        <li>What actually happened? Did your interaction change from how you expected it to go?</li>
        <li>So I saw that you used <b>&lt;payment method&gt;</b>.
          <ol>
            <li>
              How did you know that your payment went through?
            </li>
            <li>
              Why <b>&lt;payment method&gt;</b>? Why not...?
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Is any part of the payment experience ever difficult, frustrating, or stressful for you?</li>
      </ol>
