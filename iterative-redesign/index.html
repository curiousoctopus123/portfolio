            <p>
            For this project, our team created a user interface for a Y-Combinator startup named
                    <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/onscale">OnScale</a>.
                    OnScale seeks to connect creators with brands so that the creators can spend more time
                    creating. With this premise in mind, our team created concepts for webpages, then wireframes for a
                    possible
                    app, and finally, a high fidelity mock up to test with real users.
            </p>
            <h1 id="sketching">Sketching & Wireframing</h1>
            <p><a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/onscale">OnScale</a> is
            a Y-Combinator startup seeking to connect small creators to brands. We chose to make our design of
            OnScale on a desktop application. This decision is because creators, who this app is target towards, do
            most of their content creation such as editing, streaming, etc, on desktop computers.
            </p>
            <p>To kick off our redesign of the app, we each completed our own LoFi sketch based on our personal
            understanding of OnScale to generate as many ideas as possible. In total, we ended up with four sketches
            to work off of:

            <p>First, we created an interactive hifi mockup of our app design using the combined lofi design. Then, we
            presented our mockup to our class and an industry professional for critique.</p>
            <h2 class="section-subheader">Feedback & Fixes</h2>
            <p>We identified four main pieces of feedback from the critique. For each of these pieces, we discussed it
            together as a group before implementing a comprehensive fix to address it:</p>

            <h2>Changes Based on User Testing</h2>
            <p>Using the feedback from user testing, we would want to make the following changes in the future:</p>
            <ol>
                <!-- <li>
                    Add an explicit scroll bar to the horizontally scrolling platform statistics, add left/right
                    navigation
                    arrows, and/or breadcrumbs as well.
                </li> -->
                <li>
                    Graph should more explicitly show the type of referral codes being displayed (referral codes for
                    *all* companies, referral codes for X types of products, etc…) and present buttons/filter options
                    explicitly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have a way of distinguishing between former/current partners(different sections, labels, OR
                    former partners are “grayed” out) and ongoing vs. completed negotiations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a button to navigate directly from partners page to the negotiations page (or perhaps a “see
                    negotiation with X partner” button for each partner).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn the negotiation history page into a timeline-based format (current styling/format mimics the
                    non-chronological negotiation overviews too closely).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a settings page to edit bio and profile picture. Put the navigation link to the settings page
                    in the sidebar under payments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add an explanation/description to explain purpose of the Contact Onscale button on the negotiations
                    page, and/or separate into many buttons which end up contacting OnScale anyway (“Click here for
                    help, something doesn’t look right, etc…”).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Under payments section, have an option to see specifically and list out how taxes are being
                    calculated.
                </li>
            </ol>
